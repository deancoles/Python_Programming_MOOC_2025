# Please write a program which asks the user for an integer number. The program should print out "Orwell" if the number is exactly 1984, and otherwise do nothing.

# User enters a number
num = int(input("Please type in a number:"))

# If the number entered is 1984 print 'Orwell'
if num == 1984:
    print("Orwell")
